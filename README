This was a session-based packet sniffer I put together in the mid-90s in
response to a series of intrusions on my network. It's from a completely
different age, one of broadcast thinnet networking (entire subnets'
traffic visible to all systems), clear-text inter-site logins via
telnet, sendmail used without TLS, pre-SSL HTTP, etc.

I also originally used this project as fun exercise in abusing the
preprocessor, though most of that abuse has since been excised. :)

I consider it a fun little curiosity to tinker with now and then. A
pitiful, embryonic effort at rewriting it into C++ exists on a branch.
