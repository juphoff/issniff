This was a session-based packet sniffer I put together in the mid-'90s
in response to a series of intrusions on my network. It's from a
completely different age, one of repeater-driven thinnet networking
(entire subnets' traffic visible to all systems), fully-routable IP
addresses to the desktop without firewalling, clear-text inter-site
logins via telnet, sendmail used without TLS, pre-SSL HTTP, etc.

I also originally used this project as fun exercise in abusing the
preprocessor, though most of that abuse has since been excised. :)

I consider it a fun little curiosity to tinker with now and then. A
pitiful, embryonic effort at rewriting it into C++ exists on a branch.

(And, dang, I guess I need to add a formal license to this now that I've
uploaded it to Github!)
