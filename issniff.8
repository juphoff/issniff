.SH NAME
issniff \- Industrial Strength SNIFFer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
issniff
[options]
.B
[+]port
[[+]port ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBissniff\fR switches the selected network interface into "promiscuous"
mode and monitors the network traffic visible on that interface,
collecting data on TCP-protocol network connections bound for the
destination port(s) selected on the command line.  At least one port
must be specified.  A '+' prefix on a port number means to monitor
traffic in both directions on connections to that port.
.sp
When a new network connection to a selected port is detected (a
\fISYN\fR packet), \fBissniff\fR starts collecting data for that
connection.  Once the connection terminates (a \fIFIN\fR or \fIRST\fR
packet), or times out or exceeds the maximum data collection threshold,
the data collected during the duration of the connection is printed to
\fIstdout\fR, together with the connection's relevant statistics: hosts
and ports involved, time-stamps, packets, bytes, and the reason for
data-collection termination.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI -c \ cache_increment
The number of connection entries to expand the data cache by when an
expansion is required.  (Default is \fI16\fR.)
.sp
Higher values should result in an infinitesimal speed improvement, but
will also cause \fBissniff\fR to use more memory.
.TP
.BI -d \ max_data
The maximum amount of data, in bytes, to collect for a connection before
dumping its data/statistics and discontinuing data-collection.  (Default
is \fI4096\fR.)  Note that each collected byte currently takes up two
bytes of internal storage.
.TP
.BI -i \ interface
The network interface to monitor.  (Default is \fIeth0\fR.)
.TP
.B -s
"Squash" output.  Consecutive carriage-returns/newlines in the data
output will be replaced by a single newline.
.TP
.BI -t \ timeout
The maximum idle time, in seconds between successive packets, allowed
for a connection before dumping its data/statistics and discontinuing
data-collection.  (Default is \fI3600\fR, i.e. one hour.)
.sp
A timeout value of \fI0\fR disables the timeout feature.  This is not
recommended usage: \fBissniff\fR could eventually malloc() all computer
storage.
.sp
Due to the timeout algorithm used, some connections may not time out
until their idle time has significantly exceeded this threshold value.
This is not a bug.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose mode.  Output one-line descriptions of new connections to
\fIstderr\fR each time one is detected.
.TP
.B -C
Colorize output, with color selection based on the travel direction of
the packets--useful when monitoring traffic in both directions on a
port.  Session headers, statistics, etc., are uncolorized.
.sp
The color numbers are the same as for Linux's color-capable 'ls'
program:
.sp
30 black
.br
31 red
.br
32 green
.br
33 yellow
.br
34 blue
.br
35 magenta
.br
36 cyan
.br
37 white
.sp
You must have a color-capable terminal, such as the Linux console or an
xterm with colorization extensions, to use this option.
.TP
.BI -F \ color
Color number to use for output of data traveling from a monitored port
("backwards").  Implies \fB-C\fR.  (Default is \fI36\fR; cyan).
.TP
.BI -T \ color
Color number to use for output of data traveling to a monitored port.
Implies \fB-C\fR.  (Default is \fI33\fR; yellow.)
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.B USR1
Causes \fBissniff\fR to output its current state information to
\fIstderr\fR.
.TP
.B USR2
Causes \fBissniff\fR to output a summary list of the currently-active
network connections it is collecting data for to \fIstderr\fR.
.TP
.B HUP
Display full output for all currently-active connections, then resume
monitoring.
.TP
.B INT
Exit with full output for all currently-active connections.  Turns off
promiscuous mode.
.TP
.B QUIT
Exit immediately, with no output.  Turns off promiscuous mode.
.TP
.B TERM
Exit immediately, with no output.  Turns off promiscuous mode.
.TP
.B KILL
Do \fBnot\fR send a \fISIGKILL\fR to \fBissniff\fR; doing so will leave
the network interface it was monitoring in promiscuous mode.
\fBissniff\fR exits cleanly on: \fISIGINT\fR, \fISIGHUP\fR,
\fISIGQUIT\fR, and \fISIGTERM\fR.  (In fact, these are the only exit
methods supported.)
.SH BUGS
None known; however, some features and options have not yet been
implemented.
.SH REDISTRIBUTION TERMS
Explicit permission, in the form of a personally-addressed written
document or electronic mail message bearing either my written or
electronic signature, respectively, is required for legal possession
and/or use of \fBissniff\fR.  Redistribution in any form is not
permitted, under any circumstances, without explicit permission in one
of the aforementioned forms.
