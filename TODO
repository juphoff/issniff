* Problems with Linux & glibc--SEGV's.  Change to more "conventional"
  malloc'ing?  Is this what's causing Solaris to bumble around too?

* SIGUSR2 causes endless output looping.  (Not always...but what's up
  with that?!?)

* Finish implementing autoconf.

* Finish Solaris port.

* Add native command-line address selection.

* Add an rc file capability for default (no argument) usage: ~/.issniffrc

* Add optionally-invoked ncurses-based front-end.

* Add output tty selection.

* Other things, such as IPC and encrypted transfers.

* Fix occasional OSF/1 "garbling."  (Seems to have gone away now....)
