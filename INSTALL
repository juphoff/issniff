To build, do:

./configure
gmake

[Standard GNU autoconf options may be passed to configure.]

GNU make is *required*: the Makefile (generated from Makefile.in by
configure) is currently very GNU-specific.  Also, all development has
been done using gcc (the GNU C compiler): this is the only supported
compiler; the $CFLAGS et al. in the Makefile are very GCC-specific, and
will choke most other compilers badly.  Portability to other compilers
is low on my priority list and thus will likely not be seen for some
time.

Expect (i.e. ignore) compiler warnings about alignment, etc., from
OSF/1.  Linux may also complain about a zero-sized arrays in various
#include files...don't worry about that either.

Usage as a back-end for 'tcpdump' is only supported under--and only
compiles under--Linux at this time.

Read the manpage for usage.
