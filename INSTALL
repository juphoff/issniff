To build, do:

./configure
gmake

[Standard GNU autoconf options may be passed to configure.]

GNU make is required: the Makefile (generated from Makefile.in by
configure) is GNU-specific.  Also, all development has been done using
gcc (the GNU C compiler): this is the only supported compiler, as the
$CFLAGS &c. in the Makefile are very GCC-specific and will choke most
other compilers badly.  (This used to be an issue when operating systems
other than Linux were supported, e.g. SunOS.)

Usage as a back-end for 'tcpdump' is currently only supported under--and
only compiles under--Linux.

Read the manpage for usage.
