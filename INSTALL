To build, do:

make OS=os_name

where os_name is one of:

      linux	 [For Linux]
      osf	 [For Digital UNIX, a.k.a. OSF/1]
      sunos	 [For SunOS 4.1.x]

(The default, if no OS=os_name option is supplied, is linux.)

Note: GNU make is required; the Makefile is written in a very
GNU-specific manner.  Also, only GCC has been tested for code
compilation (under all OS's).  The $CFLAGS et al. in the Makefile are
very GCC-specific, and will choke most other compilers badly.

Expect (i.e. ignore) compiler warnings about alignment, etc., from SunOS
and OSF/1.  Linux may also complain about a zero-sized __data array in a
kernel #include file...don't worry about that either.

Usage as a back-end for 'tcpdump' is only supported under, and only
compiles under, Linux at this time.

Read the manpage for usage.
