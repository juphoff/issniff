To build, do:

./configure
gmake

[Standard GNU autoconf options may be passed to configure.]

GNU make is required: the Makefile (generated from Makefile.in by
configure) is currently GNU-specific.  Also, all development has been
done using gcc (the GNU C compiler): this is the only supported
compiler, as the $CFLAGS &c. in the Makefile are very GCC-specific and
will choke most other compilers badly.

Expect (i.e. ignore) compiler warnings about alignment, etc., from
OSF/1.  Linux may also complain about a zero-sized arrays in various
#include files...don't worry about that either.

Usage as a back-end for 'tcpdump' is currently only supported under--and
only compiles under--Linux.

Read the manpage for usage.
