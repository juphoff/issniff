To build, do:

./configure
gmake

[Standard GNU autoconf options may be passed to configure.]

GNU make is required: the Makefile (generated from Makefile.in by
configure) is GNU-specific.  Also, all development has been done using
gcc (the GNU C compiler): this is the only supported compiler, as the
$CFLAGS &c. in the Makefile are very GCC-specific and will choke most
other compilers badly.  (This used to be an issue when operating systems
other than Linux were supported, e.g. SunOS.)

Expect (i.e. ignore) compiler warnings about alignment, etc., from
OSF/1.  Linux may also complain about a zero-sized arrays in various
#include files...don't worry about that either.

Usage as a back-end for 'tcpdump' is currently only supported under--and
only compiles under--Linux.

Read the manpage for usage.
